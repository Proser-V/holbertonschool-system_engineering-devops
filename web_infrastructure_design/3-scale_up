Application server vs Web server

A web server serves static content (HTML, CSS, images, etc.) and forwards dynamic requests.  
An application server runs business logic and generates dynamic content.  
Both usually work together: web server for static + proxy, application server for logic.


Infrastructure

2 HAProxy load balancers (cluster) → high availability, load distribution.  
1 Web server (Nginx) → static content, SSL termination.  
1 Application server → runs code/business logic.  
1 Database server (MySQL) → persistent data storage.  


Why

HAProxy cluster prevents downtime.  
Splitting components improves scalability, flexibility, and security.  
Database separated for consistency and reliability.
